<h1> Project Proposal </h1>
<h2> Patrick, Jared & Kian </h2>

<h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3>
<p>Kent Hooper is a Professor of German and the Director of the Humanities Teaching Collection at the University of Puget Sound. He is currently conducting research on various collections of German Nursery rhymes, cataloguing the different rhymes by various information about the rhyme, including
 but not limited to: the illustrator, type of illustration, date published, etc. At the moment all of
 this data is being kept in one large excel file and is not easily manipulated. This poses
 problems for Professor Hooper as he has no way to attack his painstakingly created data set in such a
 way that he can get information about the rhymes contained within. This is a
 problem that can be addressed by storing Professor Hooper’s research in a database that can be
 queried and organized in a manner suitable to Professor Hooper. In an effort to both make Professor
 Hooper’s research more accessible to him, as well as to allow him to open up his research to the world
 as a standing collection of all the rhymes he has documented we will be emulating the
 website Professor Hooper chose (http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/), as well as attempting to add a
 portion that allows Professor Hooper to communicate with the database without having to know how to use SQL.
